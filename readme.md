## GraphQL Queries And Mutations
`users`: Retrieve all users along with their associated scans. </br>
`user`: Search for a specific user along with their associated scans. </br>
`scans`: Retrieve the number of scans for each activity with optional filters for specific criteria such as min_frequency, max_frequency, or activity_category. </br>
`nextMeal`: Finds the next (or current) meal startTime and endTime. </br>
`addUser`: Create a new user. </br>
`addScan`: Add a scan for a user. (This will update the User.updatedAt field) </br>
`updateUser`: Update a user's name, phone, badgecode. (This will update the User.updatedAt field) </br>
`setMealtime`: Sets a meal and its startTime and endTime. Allows for updating a current meal's times. </br>

## Design Choices
- I decided to create a one-to-many relationship so that each "User" can have several "Scans".
- Each scan is linked to a specific user through the userId column (foreign key).
- Even though it was specified that the badge codes are unique, I decided to use a `userId` column to give user a unique uuid — if the requirements were to change in the future, this would ensure that every user has a unique identifier.
- Similarily, I created a `scanId`, even though it's not needed at the moment. Future requirements might find it useful to have a unique identifier for each scan.
- I used a raw SQL query in `services/scanService.js` for the `scans` requirements to show my ability to construct SQL queries (I was working on this stuff at my CRA internship).
- I initially had a query to get scans by userId but removed it because of redundancy -> graphql allows you to retrieve speicifc data that you want so it has the same functionality as using the user query and asking for the user's scan data.

## Assumptions:    
- When the badge_code was empty in the JSON file, I created to create a temporary badge_code labeled `temp-RANDOM`.
- I can see in the example_data.json that users can scan into the same activity_name multiple times, so I don't have anything blocking multiple of the same scans for the same user.

## Bonus:
Sometimes, as a hacker, you're so absolutely locked in that you can't seem to remember when dinner is coming up! Well you're in luck now — I created a mutation that allows the Hack the North team to set meal times, and a query that allows hackers to see when the next meal time is coming up, with its start and end times.
